# Batch Cleanup

This is a simple VBScript that cleans up folders and files in Windows based on paths stored in a .txt file.

## How to use it
1. Run the script called Cleanup.vbs.
2. If there are no paths in the "Cleanup paths.txt" file, then the script will open it up in Notepad so you can add paths.
3. After saving the paths in the .txt file, then run the Cleanup.vbs script again.
4. Wait for a message box indicating that cleanup completed.
